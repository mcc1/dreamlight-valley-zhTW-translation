"Kristoff_004_f", "Hey, Kristoff, you play the lute, right?"
"Kristoff_005_f", "Sure. Why do you ask?"
"Player_000_f", "Stitch is starting a band. He was hoping you might join."
"Player_000_choice_000_f", "You two would really rock together!"
"Player_000_choice_001_f", "It would make Stitch happy."
"Player_000_choice_002_f", "You're the only person around here with a lute."
"Kristoff_007_f", "You think so? I don't know if we'd be a great match as performers."
"Kristoff_010_f", "Music is something I kind of do for me. I haven't performed much in front of crowds."
"Player_001_choice_000_f", "It's good to get outside your comfort zone."
"Player_001_choice_001_f", "It would mean the world to Stitch."
"Player_001_choice_002_f", "You don't have to do it if you don't want to."
"Kristoff_011_f", "You know, maybe you're right. This might be fun."
"Kristoff_014_f", "Stitch and I... making music for the whole Village."
"Kristoff_015_f", "This is either gonna be great or a complete disaster."
"Kristoff_016_f", "You better start practicing. I'm going to go <Lore>talk to Mr. McDuck</Lore>."
"Kristoff_017_f", "Now that we've got the band together, we're going to need some sound equipment. Maybe he has some he can loan us."
"Kristoff_012_f", "Well, if it would help the little guy feel more at home in the Village, maybe I should."
"Kristoff_013_f", "Thanks, {PlayerName}. But... You know what? I'll do it."
"Kristoff_008_f", "Are you sure there isn't somebody else who'd be better?"
"Kristoff_009_f", "Well, that's true. But I'm not sure if just having a lute qualifies me for this."
