"Kristoff_000_f", "Hey, {PlayerName}. Wait, is that a sock?"
"Kristoff_002_f", "I found it lying on the ground. It's orange, so I figured it might be yours."
"Kristoff_006_f", "You know... since you really like carrots."
"Kristoff_003_f", "Sorry, no. That's not my sock."
"Kristoff_004_f", "And that's not really carrot-orange, is it? Looks more like pumpkin-orange to me."
"Kristoff_010_f", "Pumpkins are more of a Fairy Godmother thing."
"Player_000_choice_000_f", "You can see how I'd make that mistake."
"Player_000_choice_001_f", "Whoops. Sorry. My bad."
"Player_000_choice_002_f", "Oh, right. They're subtly but noticeably different shades of orange."
"Kristoff_005_f", "Wait a second. That's not my sock, but now that I look more closely, I think I've seen it before."
"Kristoff_011_f", "Socks like that were hanging up on a clothes line <Lore>near Merlin's library</Lore>."
"Kristoff_007_f", "Hmm... <Lore>who would be hanging up their laundry there</Lore>? I guess I'll go check."
