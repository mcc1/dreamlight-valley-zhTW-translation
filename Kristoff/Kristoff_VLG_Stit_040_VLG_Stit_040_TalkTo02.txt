"Kristoff_004_f", "Hey, Kristoff, you play the lute, right?"
"Kristoff_005_f", "Sure. Why do you ask?"
"Player_000_f", "Stitch is starting a band. He was hoping you might join."
"Player_000_choice_000_f", "You two would really rock together!"
"Player_000_choice_001_f", "It would make Stitch happy."
"Player_000_choice_002_f", "You're the only person around here with a lute."
"Kristoff_006_f", "You think so? I don't know if we'd be a great match as performers."
"Kristoff_016_f", "You won't have to do it alone. Prince Eric is going to do it too!"
"Kristoff_018_f", "Well, that might help. But still..."
"Kristoff_007_f", "Music is something I kind of do for me. I haven't performed much in front of crowds."
"Player_001_choice_000_f", "It's good to get outside your comfort zone."
"Player_001_choice_001_f", "It would mean the world to Stitch."
"Player_001_choice_002_f", "You don't have to do it if you don't want to."
"Kristoff_008_f", "You know, maybe you're right. This might be fun."
"Kristoff_019_f", "Stitch, Eric, and I... making music for the whole Village."
"Kristoff_010_f", "This is either gonna be great or a complete disaster."
"Kristoff_011_f", "Well... better start practicing!"
"Kristoff_020_f", "Now that we've got the whole band together, I'm going to go <Lore>talk to Mr. McDuck</Lore>."
"Kristoff_021_f", "We'll need sound equipment. He might have some he can loan us."
"Kristoff_022_f", "I'll <Lore>keep looking for one more member to join the band</Lore>."
"Kristoff_023_f", "Sounds good. Hey, isn't there somebody around here who plays a flute...?"
"Kristoff_009_f", "Stitch and I... making music for the whole Village."
"Kristoff_012_f", "Well, if it would help the little guy feel more at home in the Village, maybe I should."
"Kristoff_013_f", "Thanks, {PlayerName}. But... You know what? I'll do it."
"Kristoff_017_f", "You won't have to do it alone. I'm still looking for somebody else to join the band."
"Kristoff_014_f", "Are you sure there isn't somebody else who'd be better?"
"Kristoff_015_f", "Well, that's true. But I'm not sure if just having a lute qualifies me for this."
