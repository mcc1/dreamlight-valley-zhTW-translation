"Ursula_000_f", "Ugh. Why are you bringing that rude, bratty creature to my home?"
"Player_000_choice_000_f", "He was curious about you."
"Player_000_choice_001_f", "I just wanted to introduce you."
"Player_000_choice_002_f", "He wanted to meet a sea monster."
"Ursula_002_f", "Angelfish, curiosity is hardly a reason to barge into my abode with that beast in tow."
"Ursula_006_f", "I've hardly been able to get a moment's peace with him running amok in the Village."
"Ursula_007_f", "Why, just the other day, he pestered me about my "badness level". Can you imagine?"
"Ursula_008_f", "Get him out of here before something... unfortunate... happens."
"Ursula_003_f", "Oh, angelfish, I've already met that little beast."
"Ursula_004_f", "A SEA MONSTER?!"
"Ursula_005_f", "The only monster around here is that little beast."
