"Mickey_000_f", "Hiya, {PlayerName}! Do you need some help?"
"Mickey_002_f", "I do. Donald thinks the Village is under invasion by sock-stealing space aliens."
"Mickey_003_f", "Ha-ha! Yeah, I've heard him talkin' about it."
"Player_000_f", "I've been investigating to try to..."
"Player_000_choice_000_f", "...find the space aliens and stop them!"
"Player_000_choice_001_f", "...prove there aren't any space aliens."
"Player_000_choice_002_f", "...figure out what's going on."
"Mickey_005_f", "Gosh, so you really think we've got space aliens stealin' socks around here?"
"Mickey_006_f", "I know it. I'm on the trail of another clue."
"Mickey_009_f", "I found this <ActivityItem>Knitted Sock</ActivityItem>. Is it yours?"
"Mickey_010_f", "I don't think so. It doesn't look like any of my other socks, so even if the Forgetting made me forget, I doubt it's one of mine."
"Mickey_011_f", "Say... I think I remember somebody making those, though."
"Mickey_015_f", "It was the Fairy Godmother!"
"Mickey_017_f", "She's always doing whatever she can to make sure everybody in the Village is happy and taken care of... even making sure our feet are warm!"
"Mickey_014_f", "I bet she conjured these to give to somebody special as a gift."
"Mickey_013_f", "I guess I'll have to figure out who that someone special was. Thanks, Mickey!"
"Mickey_012_f", "It was somebody who used to take care of everybody in the Village... including making sure our feet stayed warm."
"Mickey_016_f", "If I try real hard, I can almost remember what she looked like... but not quite."
"Mickey_007_f", "So you don't think there are space aliens here? But who's stealing all the socks?"
"Mickey_008_f", "That's what I'm trying to figure out. I'm on the trail of another clue."
"Mickey_018_f", "Oh boy! So you think there might really be sock-stealin' space aliens around here?"
"Mickey_019_f", "We can't rule anything out. I'm on the trail of another clue."
