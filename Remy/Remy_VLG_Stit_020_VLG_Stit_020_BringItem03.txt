"Remy_001_f", "Hey, {PlayerName}, what have you got there?"
"Remy_002_f", "Wait—are those <ActivityItem>Coffee Beans</ActivityItem>?!"
"Remy_012_f", "Stitch and WALL·E helped me grow a new tree full of them."
"Remy_017_f", "They'll be growing all over the Village soon."
"Remy_013_f", "That... is... amazing!"
"Remy_014_f", "I can add so much to my menu!"
"Remy_018_f", "I'm wondering what I should make first."
"Player_000_choice_000_f", "Maybe something nice and frothy that you can have with cake?"
"Player_000_choice_001_f", "Maybe something with chocolate in it?"
"Player_000_choice_002_f", "I just need something simple to help Stitch."
"Remy_005_f", "I've got just the thing."
"Remy_007_f", "Throw a dash of <ActivityItem>Milk</ActivityItem> in with the beans, froth to perfection..."
"Remy_008_f", "And my friend, you will have a <ActivityItem>Latte</ActivityItem> in no time."
"Remy_015_f", "That's a good idea. But I'm not sure it's quite right."
"Remy_006_f", "Well, if you throw these beans together with a little bit of <ActivityItem>Milk</ActivityItem>... and some <ActivityItem>Chocolate</ActivityItem>..."
"Remy_009_f", "You'll have a delicious <ActivityItem>Mocha</ActivityItem>."
"Remy_016_f", "Sounds amazing. But I think I need something different."
"Remy_003_f", "Well, simple is the way to go with high quality beans like this."
"Remy_004_f", "You can prepare them like you would any other meal."
"Remy_010_f", "But make sure NOT to give it to Stitch before bedtime!"
"Remy_011_f", "And one cup a day is probably enough. With Stitch, there's such a thing as TOO much energy."
