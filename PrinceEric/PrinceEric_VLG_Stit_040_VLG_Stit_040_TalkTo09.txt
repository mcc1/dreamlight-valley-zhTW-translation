"PrinceEric_003_f", "Hey, Eric... you play the flute, right?"
"PrinceEric_004_f", "I do. But I haven't had much chance to practice lately."
"PrinceEric_005_f", "I'm kind of rusty."
"PrinceEric_006_f", "Not too rusty, I hope? Stitch is putting together a band. I think it'd be great if you'd play with him."
"PrinceEric_012_f", "Kristoff has already agreed to join. I think you'd make a great trio."
"Player_000_choice_000_f", "You could get some practice with your flute again."
"Player_000_choice_001_f", "Stitch would love to have a prince in his band."
"Player_000_choice_002_f", "It's just for fun. No pressure."
"PrinceEric_007_f", "Well, it would give me the chance to play more and learn some new songs."
"PrinceEric_013_f", "Sure, I'll do it!"
"PrinceEric_014_f", "Great! Start practicing. In the meantime, I'm going to <Lore>talk to Mr. McDuck</Lore>."
"PrinceEric_017_f", "Now that we've got a band together, you'll need to put on a concert. Maybe he has some sound equipment he can lend us."
"PrinceEric_015_f", "Great! Now I just have to <Lore>find one more band member...</Lore>"
"PrinceEric_016_f", "Hmm... isn't there someone around here who plays the lute?"
"PrinceEric_008_f", "You might be right. He was asking me something about a music-playing king the other day, but I'd never heard of him."
"PrinceEric_009_f", "It would be fun to play music with other people again."
